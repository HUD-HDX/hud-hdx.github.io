  <h2>System Performance Measures (SPM) Issues for the FY25 Submission Period</h2>
Throughout the submission period, we will use this space to provide general information about known issues with the SPM module in HDX 2.0. Please check back regularly to remain up to date on the status of all bugs and flag issues we are actively addressing.

The FY 2025 SPM submission period opens February 2, 2026 at 8:00 AM ET and closes on March 4, 2026, at 8:00 PM ET.

  <h2>Users Take Note</h2>
<ul>
  <li>During this submission period, as usual, SPMs will also accept resubmissions from the penultimate fiscal year. That is, this year FY24 resubmissions will be accepted (if they are uploaded) in addition to the mandatory FY25 submissions.</li>
  <li>Do not attempt to upload .zip files. Check the file extension of the file that your HMIS produces. The file should end in .csv not .zip. The SPM requires a .csv upload. </li></ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
If you are noticing some aspect of the SPM, HIC, or PIT module not working as expected, we recommend the following steps:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Log Out and Log Back In Again</b>: Often the best first step to make sure something is really not working as expected.  ​
</li>
  <li> <b>Try a different browser</b>: the HDX team recommends Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge for using HDX. These are the two browsers that were used most consistently for testing the site. Users have reported isolated incidents of issues that have been specific to Mozilla Firefox.</li>
  <li> <b>Reset the Application</b>: When you reset the application, you won't lose any work you've already saved. Instead, this clears any cached data that has been loaded from the HDX database since the last time a new release was issued (which usually happens about every two weeks). This can have the effect of giving your experience of one of these modules a fresh start. To reset any one of these modules, access any one of the three (SPM, HIC or PIT), and then click on your name in the top right corner and select "Reset App" as shown. It can also be helpful to log out and log back in again. </li>
</ul>
